# RapidFabVentilator
A low cost rapidly deployable ventilator for emergency use during the COVID-19 outbreak. To ensure availability I'm attempting to construct as much of the device out of readily available materials such as PVB tubing and components that can be purchased on Amazon. To increase throughput I'm trying to use as few 3D printed parts as possible and instead have tried to apply 2D designs to as many larger parts as possible in hopes of having these parts swiftly fabricated by local lazer cutting shops out of acrylic or possibly wood. I haven't gotten to far with the electronics yet, but am utilizing an ESP8266 as the brains integrated with the BMP280 (Temperature, Pressure, Humidity), and an 16x2 LCD screen (both over I2C).
